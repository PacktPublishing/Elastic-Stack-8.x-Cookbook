Raghunandan (Kunchacko Boban) is a native of Chenankuzhi village and the son of Gangadharan (Innocent), the village postman. Gangadharan is a lazy man and does not do his duties well. Raghu has to face the anger of the villagers because his father does not deliver the mails or money orders in time. Raghu on the other hand is a hard working young man and does any help to the villagers. He is in love with Usha (Meera Nandan), a student in the PSC exam coaching class where he does part-time teaching. Raghu also plays the mediator in most of the village's major issues. In one such attempt, he meets Yasin Mubarak (Sarath Kumar) and this meeting changes his life forever.
